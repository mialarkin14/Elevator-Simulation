Building & Compiling the Code:

** !! MAKE SURE ALLEGRO5 IS INSTALLED ON YOUR DEVICE !! **


Easy Way: ( This assumes you are using a MacBook Machine )

1. Use the Makefile that was created to simply build the code. This will create an executable called simulate
2. Once an executable is created, call it using "./" notion along with whatever test file you want to use 
3. Ex: 
   make 
   ./simulate test1.txt
4. This runs the code and an animation should start


Complex Way: ( A general build, not specific to MacBook )
1. The following cpp files need to be built:
    - ECGraphicViewImp.cpp
    - ECElevatorSim.cpp
    - Simulate.cpp
    - Passenger.cpp
    - Elevator.cpp
2. This should be followed by the build for Allegro5 which is typically: -lallegro -lallegro_font -lallegro_primitives -lallegro_image -lallegro_main
3. Version c++17 should be used to avoid warnings
4. The name of the executable by default is a.out but can be changed using -o "new_name_here"
5. Ex:
   g++ ECGraphicViewImp.cpp ECElevatorSim.cpp Simulate.cpp Passenger.cpp Elevator.cpp -lallegro -lallegro_font -lallegro_primitives -lallegro_image -lallegro_main -std=c++17 -o simulate
   ./simulate test1.txt
